# Creating Posts and News :memo:

In Digital-Future we give the opportunity that **everyone** can upload any posts or news. Before uploading anything, it needs to be **reviewed** by other administrators to determine if the publication doesn't brake any **rule of content** or it have something inappropriate.

## Rules of publications

These are some **rules** that all posts or news need to accomplish:

- All the content is **truthful** and extracted from trusty sources _(giving the appropriate credit to the source)_. :bookmark:

## Writing a post

Since the Website is made with Jekyll, you can create your post using **markdown**. Here you can find a great guide about [writing with markdown :pencil2:.](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

Here are some nice tutorials and recommendations of **how to** write a post the right way and make it reach more people.
- [How to make a good post.](https://masymejor.com/hacer-un-buen-post/)
- [How to write an attractive post.](https://www.40defiebre.com/como-escribir-post/)
- [27 recommendations for writing a post](https://www.40defiebre.com/consejos-escribir-post/)

If you want to know more about the syntax of writing posts, you can read the [Jekyll posts documentation.](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/)

### Naming the documents

When you write a post or new, the name of the document need to be like:

```java
YYYY-MM-DD-name_of_the_post.md
-----------------------------------
Example:
2018-02-26-writing_my_first_post.md
```
### Storing the files
The document with the **.md** file where you write the post, need to by **stored** in the [\_posts](/_posts/) folder :open_file_folder:.

If you are using **local images**, you need to create a **new folder** with the name of your post inside [assets/posts](/assets/posts/). Then you can save all your images in your folder.

Example: _saving the (cover.png, imagen1.jpg, imagen2.jpg)_
```
assets
    |
    posts
        | ****this is the folder you create with the name of your post****
        2018-02-26-writing_my_first_post
            | ****here is where you store your images****
            cover.png
            imagen1.jpg
            imagen2.jpg
```
